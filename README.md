 Firebase Integration with Android Project This guide will help you integrate Firebase into your Android project. Follow the steps below to set up Firebase, add necessary dependencies, and implement Firebase services like Authentication, Firestore, and Analytics.
# Prerequisites
- Android Studio installed
- A Firebase account
- An existing Android project
# Step-by-Step Instructions
## Step 1: Create a Firebase Project
- Go to the Firebase Console.
- Click on "Add project".
- Enter a project name and follow the on-screen instructions to create the project.
## Step 2: Register Your App with Firebase
- In the Firebase Console, click on "Add app" and select "Android".
- Enter your app's package name (found in your AndroidManifest.xml file).
- Register the app and download the google-services.json file.
## Step 3: Add google-services.json to Your Project
- Place the google-services.json file in the app/ directory of your Android project.
## Step 4: Add Firebase SDK to Your Project
- Open your project's build.gradle (Project-level) file and add the following line in the dependencies section:

classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.14'
- In your build.gradle (App-level) file, add the following lines at the bottom:

apply plugin:'com.google.gms.google-services'

- Add the necessary Firebase dependencies. For example, to use Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and Analytics, add:
  
dependencies {

    implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-auth:22.0.0'
